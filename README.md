# Hands on Creating Agent Tools and Tool Calling by LLMs with LangChain

# 🧑‍💻 Hands-On: Creating Agent Tools and Tool Calling with LLMs using LangChain

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that provides a **practical, beginner-friendly guide** to building **agent tools** and enabling **tool calling** using **LangChain**.  
The goal is to help learners understand how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be extended with external tools and APIs for real-world use cases.
